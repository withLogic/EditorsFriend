# Editor's Friend

Editor's Friend is a tool that will attempt to remove most formatting from PDF, DOCX, and DOC files and reset the formatting to a default state. This can be helpful for editors that receive documents from writers and need to ensure consistant formatting before editing and republishing in other sources, like a magazine or newsletter.
